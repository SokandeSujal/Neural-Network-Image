# Neural Network Image Classifier

## Description

This project implements a neural network for image classification.  Further details on the specific classification task and dataset used are unavailable without access to the source code files.

## Features

*   **Image Loading and Preprocessing:** The code likely includes functionality to load and preprocess images for input into the neural network.  Specific preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, normalization) cannot be determined without access to the source code.
*   **Neural Network Model:** A neural network model is implemented. The architecture (e.g., convolutional neural network, fully connected network) and specifics of the model (e.g., number of layers, activation functions) are not available without access to the code.
*   **Training and Evaluation:** The project likely includes functionality to train the neural network on a dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy.  Details regarding the training process (e.g., optimizer, loss function, batch size) are unavailable without code access.
*   **Prediction:** The code probably allows for making predictions on new, unseen images using the trained neural network.
